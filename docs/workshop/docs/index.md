# Microhack Challenges Hands-On Lab : Knowledge Mining

The Micohack event is designed to engage technical roles through a condensed, half-day hands-on hack experience. Leveraging the latest Microsoft technologies, this event provides participants with the opportunity to work on real-world problems, collaborate with peers, and explore innovative solutions. 

The Microhack event is divided into several key challenges, each carefully crafted to test and expand the participants' proficiency with Microsoft's suite of tools. These challenges are not only technical in nature but also reflect real-world scenarios that businesses face, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to apply theoretical knowledge practically. 

 

### Hack Duration: 2 hours 

 

The event kicks off with an initial overview of the customer scenario for the business problem the participants will solve by leveraging cutting-edge technology and services.  

Following this, the team will complete the setup phase, where participants ensure that their development environments are correctly configured, and all necessary tools are ready for use.  

Finally, they will tackle the first challenge, which involves identifying key ideas that underpin the implementation of Microsoft technologies in solving predefined problems.
