# Before you begin

To get started, make sure you have the following resources and permissions:

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin.
- An Azure AI Foundry hub is required to manage the resources provisioned in your Content Understanding project, and it must be created in one of the following supported regions: westus, swedencentral, or australiaeast. If you're creating a hub for the first time, see [How to create and manage an Azure AI Foundry hub to learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource?tabs=portal). It's important to note you need the proper permissions to create a hub, or your admin may create one for you. 
- If your role is Contributor or Owner, you can proceed with creating your own hub.
- If your role is Azure AI Developer, the hub must already be created before you can complete this quickstart. Your user role must be Azure AI Developer, Contributor, or Owner on the hub. For more information, see [hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-resources) and [Azure AI roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/rbac-azure-ai-foundry).
