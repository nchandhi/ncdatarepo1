10. Select the connected Fabric data agent. Under additional details, you can optionally decide the authentication of the Fabric data agent to be the User authentication or Agent author authentication. If you select User authentication as the authentication, you need to ensure that users have access to the Fabric data agent and its underlying data sources.

11. You could use the built-in test chat pane on the right to ask questions and get answers. This helps you to validate the performance of the custom AI agent to ensure it invokes the connected Fabric data agents to get answers and further fine-tune its behavior.

12. Ensure that you have enabled generative AI orchestration. To do this, select Settings that is located on the top of the chat pane and under Orchestration, select the first one.
